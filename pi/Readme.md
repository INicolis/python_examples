A simple although not very efficient way to compute π using probabilities.
The program picks random points in a unitary square. The probability of the points to be in the circle is equal to the area ratio of the circle to the square, π/4.
The program prints the estimation, the error from the real value and the upper limit of the error expected for the algorithm, then traces a visualisation of all drawn points.
